[04-08-2021 20:22:36] [I] Niffles: we got silicon!!
[04-08-2021 20:22:39] [I] Teeler: There, ripple turrets
[04-08-2021 20:22:44] [I] Teeler: We *do*?
[04-08-2021 20:22:46] [I] Niffles: we need phase tho
[04-08-2021 20:22:50] [I] Teeler: Wave 60!
[04-08-2021 20:22:55] [I] Teeler: Never gotten this far before!
[04-08-2021 20:23:29] [I] Niffles: no kidding
[04-08-2021 20:25:05] [I] Teeler: The energy weapons are good
[04-08-2021 20:25:05] [I] Niffles: YEs we have silicopn
[04-08-2021 20:25:22] [I] Teeler: Because we have tons of energy storage
[04-08-2021 20:25:26] [I] Teeler: And lots of solar
[04-08-2021 20:25:37] [I] Niffles: woa

[04-08-2021 20:36:06] [I] Niffles: We need to keep power and menders to core
[04-08-2021 20:36:10] [I] Niffles: we wont recover tho
[04-08-2021 20:38:22] [I] Teeler: yee
[04-08-2021 20:38:45] [I] Niffles: Im going to fill all empty space with armor and see how long we last
[04-08-2021 20:39:08] [I] Teeler: Got it
[04-08-2021 20:42:07] [I] Teeler: 67!!!
[04-08-2021 20:42:13] [I] Niffles: HOldup can we make aitr units
[04-08-2021 20:42:14] [I] Teeler: My god
[04-08-2021 20:42:19] [I] Teeler: WALLS
[04-08-2021 20:42:21] [I] Teeler: Can we?
[04-08-2021 20:42:42] [I] Niffles: darnit needs silicon

[04-08-2021 20:43:17] [I] Teeler: that's one we can reconstruct
[04-08-2021 20:43:35] [I] Niffles: Yep
[04-08-2021 20:44:04] [I] Niffles: Ammunition supply conveyors are like 50% not working

[04-08-2021 20:55:26] [I] Niffles: We have led walls tho
[04-08-2021 20:55:40] [I] Niffles: In this version can you swap your player to another mech somehow?
[04-08-2021 20:55:45] [I] Teeler: IDK how
[04-08-2021 20:55:48] [I] Teeler: I think you *can*
[04-08-2021 20:56:35] [I] Teeler: This is a smaller one
[04-08-2021 20:56:39] [I] Teeler: Unless they're T5
[04-08-2021 20:56:43] [I] Teeler: which hopefully they're not?
[04-08-2021 20:56:44] [I] Niffles: Nexty save we need to get units vs turrets
[04-08-2021 20:57:00] [I] Niffles: T5S?
[04-08-2021 20:57:03] [I] Niffles: Are those these>

[04-08-2021 21:02:59] [I] Teeler: 44 enemies
[04-08-2021 21:06:05] [I] Teeler: Damnit
[04-08-2021 21:06:12] [I] Teeler: The fuse ones require titaniuim
[04-08-2021 21:06:16] [I] Niffles: Frick
[04-08-2021 21:06:18] [I] Teeler: We don't have much of that

[04-08-2021 21:06:39] [I] Niffles: big hole
[04-08-2021 21:07:13] [I] Niffles: Copper will have to do
[04-08-2021 21:08:00] [I] Teeler: Done
[04-08-2021 21:08:03] [I] Teeler: 78 is it, I think
[04-08-2021 21:09:24] [I] Niffles: And we can't make an unloader so the fuses are down
[04-08-2021 21:09:34] [I] Teeler: OH NO!
[04-08-2021 21:10:44] [I] Niffles: But do not fret! for I have brought titanium
[04-08-2021 21:10:56] [I] Niffles: damit silicon
[04-08-2021 21:11:08] [I] Teeler: I just want 80!

[04-08-2021 21:12:50] [I] Niffles: FUSE ONLINE!@
[04-08-2021 21:12:54] [I] Teeler: YES
[04-08-2021 21:15:53] [I] Teeler: Bring *all* the lancers online you can
[04-08-2021 21:15:57] [I] Niffles: Ince we run out of copper unlikely we die
[04-08-2021 21:16:07] [I] Teeler: All the energy units
[04-08-2021 21:16:20] [I] Teeler: We can continue to make arcs
[04-08-2021 21:16:58] [I] Teeler: Thank goodness for those batteries
[04-08-2021 21:17:11] [I] Teeler: Otherwise supporting all of these energy weapons would be impossible
[04-08-2021 21:17:26] [I] Niffles: Making some silicon
[04-08-2021 21:17:34] [I] Niffles: Or not
[04-08-2021 21:17:38] [I] Niffles: Just got bombed
[04-08-2021 21:17:57] [I] Niffles: Wave 100 we can do it
[04-08-2021 21:18:04] [I] Niffles: Batrely limping
[04-08-2021 21:18:09] [I] Niffles: NOO
[04-08-2021 21:18:12] [I] Teeler: If we keep the menders online, maybe?
